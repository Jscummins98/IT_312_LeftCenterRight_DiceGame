# IT_312_LeftCenterRight_DiceGame
Final project for IT-312 Software Development w/C++.Net

The LCR dice game consists of at least 3 players who each begin the game with 3 chips. The goal is to be the last player still in possession of chips. For each round of the game, one player will roll a number of dice corresponding to the number of chips in their possession. If the player has 3 or more chips, they will roll 3 dice. Otherwise, they will roll the same number of dice as chips in their hand. The dice has 6 sides each corresponding to a different action to be taken by the player. Rolling a 1 means the player must pass a chip to the player on their left while a 2 means the player must pass a chip to the player on their right. A 3 means the player must pass a chip to the center pot where the chip is no longer in play for the rest of the game. If the player rolls a 4, 5, or 6, nothing happens. In order to create a program to run this game, two classes are necessary. A player class will store information relating to each player in the game such as their name and the number of chips in their possession as well as functions that add or remove chips from their hand. A game display class will be responsible for executing the logic for the game such as organizing the players into a list, rolling the dice for each player, and figuring out if someone has won the game or not.
